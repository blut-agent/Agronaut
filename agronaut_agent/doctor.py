"""`agronaut doctor` — which half of your setup is broken.

Built because the maintainer typed `agronaut doctor` twice, on two different days, while
stuck on a problem this command answers in a second. The problem was that a stale copy of
the package, left in site-packages by an older wheel, was shadowing an editable install; the
tool showed the old behaviour, `pip show` reported a version that matched neither, and
nothing anywhere would say which files were actually loaded.

The design copies `whatsapp_doctor`, which already worked: a flat list of `Check`, each with
a status, a label, a detail and a `fix:` line, rendered together with an exit code. That
command becomes one section here rather than a separate thing to remember.

Two rules the checks all follow:

* **Nothing may raise.** This is what you run when things are already broken, so a check that
  throws is reported as that check failing, never as a traceback.
* **Offline is a normal state.** A check that needs the network says it was skipped rather
  than claiming a failure it did not observe.
