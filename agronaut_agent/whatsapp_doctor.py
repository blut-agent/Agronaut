"""Check a WhatsApp setup end to end, and fix the one thing Meta's dashboard hides.

WhatsApp has more moving parts than Telegram, and most of them fail SILENTLY. A setup can
look complete in Meta's UI, answer the webhook handshake correctly, and still deliver every
message somewhere you will never see. There is no error anywhere; the bot simply never
replies, which tells an operator nothing about which of eight things is wrong.

The worst offender, and the reason this module exists: Meta's dashboard shows
"Configure Webhooks ✅" once the callback URL verifies, but verifying the URL does NOT
subscribe your app to your own WhatsApp Business Account. On a fresh account the WABA is
subscribed to Meta's internal "WA DevX Webhook Events 1P App" instead, so inbound messages
go there. The dashboard offers no way to see this and no way to change it: the only route
is POST /{waba-id}/subscribed_apps. Someone can lose an afternoon to it, because every
visible indicator says the setup is finished.

So this runs the checks in dependency order (a bad token makes every later check
meaningless) and reports the FIRST thing that is actually wrong, with the fix.
