"""Cited coefficient layer — the trust artifact.

Every magic number the model uses lives here as a `Coefficient` with a value, a
plausible range, a unit, and a SOURCE. Functions read from this registry; they never
hard-code numbers. When a design runs, it echoes exactly which coefficients (and which
sources) it used, so an institutional reviewer can audit the math without trusting any LLM.

IMPORTANT — these are SEED DEFAULTS, not universal truths. Aquaponics coefficients vary by
species, cultivar, climate, feed, and system type. The whole point of the calibration step
(validate against a real running system) is to replace these defaults with measured values.
Ranges are deliberately wide to reflect that uncertainty; a conservative SAFETY_FACTOR is
applied where undersizing would be dangerous (biofilter, aeration).
