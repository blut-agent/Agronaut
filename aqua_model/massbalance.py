"""Mass balance: nitrogen CONSISTENCY CHECK, water balance, biofilter sizing.

  FEED  ──FRR sizes──▶  the system (see sizing.py)
    │
    │  nitrogen flows (THIS module — a CHECK, not a sizing path):
    ▼
  N_fed = feed * protein% * 0.16
    │
    ├─ N_retained = growth * body_protein% * 0.16   (growth = feed / FCR)
    │
    └─ N_excreted = N_fed - N_retained
          │
          ├─ plants take up ~30-50% (PLANT_N_UPTAKE_FRACTION)   ◀── checked vs FRR area
          └─ the rest leaves via solids / water-exchange / denitrification
                                  (estimated INDEPENDENTLY, not as a residual)

The check never RESIZES anything. It asks: does the FRR-sized grow area roughly match the
area the nitrogen flow implies? If they disagree beyond tolerance, it raises a flag instead
of silently reconciling. (This is what makes the test non-vacuous: sinks are independent.)

    Uses the cited SOLIDS_PRODUCTION_FRACTION coefficient (g solids / g feed).
    This is the production side: how much solids the fish produce regardless of
    what the system captures. Slice 2 adds the capture side (how much is removed
    by settling, swirl, drum filter, etc.).
